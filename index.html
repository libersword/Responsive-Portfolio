    <p class="about-paragraph">My name is Lindsey Brown. I have a BFA in Graphic Design and a minor in computer science. I am currently working as a Web Designer in Boulder, CO and am striving to become a frontend web developer. I am a Colorado native, originally from the western slope. I went to college in Grand Junction, CO at Colorado Mesa University. I was first inspired to get into computer science when I visited CU Boulder and saw the BTU lab. It showed my the fun of computers combined with art. </p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">I have a sweet one eyed rescue cat named Captain. I play a lot of videogames and go to every heavy metal show I can feasibly go to. I collect a lot of vinyl records and meticulously categorize them. I am also an artist, I like to draw and paint whenever I get the chance, as well as do some digital art like vector graphics and digital painting.
